# Dynamic API earbuds

## Introduction
This project showcases a website for a set of wireless earbuds. The site dynamically displays the materials used in the earbuds, fetched from an API. It also includes a loading animation that appears when the API data is being loaded. When the site is loaded, it will make an API call to retrieve the materials of the earbuds. If the data isn't loaded yet, a swirl animation will appear to indicate that the content is loading.

## Features

3D model of the earbuds: Used to show off the product interactively within the site
Hotspots: Used on the 3D display to show off the features of the earbuds
Dynamic Materials Display: The site pulls data from an API to show the materials used in the earbuds in real-time
AJAX Integration: AJAX is used to fetch data from the API without reloading the page
Loading Swirl: A loading animation is displayed while the materials data is being fetched from the API

## Technologies Used
### HTML/Sass:

### JavaScript:
